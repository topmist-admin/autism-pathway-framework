# Disclaimer

## Research Use Only

This framework is intended **exclusively for research and educational purposes**. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, screening, or treatment recommendations.

---

## Not a Clinical Tool

This framework:

- **Does NOT** diagnose autism or any other condition
- **Does NOT** provide clinical screening capabilities
- **Does NOT** recommend treatments or interventions
- **Does NOT** make predictions about individual outcomes
- **Does NOT** replace professional medical judgment

---

## Limitations

### Scientific Limitations

1. **Hypothesis-generating only**: All outputs are preliminary hypotheses requiring independent experimental validation
2. **Pathway definitions are incomplete**: Curated pathways are biased toward well-studied biology and do not capture all biological processes
3. **Static models**: The framework does not account for:
   - Developmental timing
   - Cell-type specificity
   - Compensatory mechanisms
   - Environmental influences
   - Gene-environment interactions

4. **No causal claims**: Associations identified do not establish causality
5. **Cohort-dependent**: Results may not generalize across populations or sequencing technologies

### Technical Limitations

1. **Data quality dependent**: Outputs are only as reliable as input data
2. **Parameter sensitivity**: Results may vary with analytical choices
3. **Computational approximations**: Network propagation and clustering involve simplifying assumptions

## Ethical Considerations

### Respect for Neurodiversity

This framework is designed with respect for the autism community. Autism is a complex aspect of human diversity, and this research aims to advance scientific understanding—not to pathologize or stigmatize.

### Data Privacy

Genomic data is uniquely identifying and highly sensitive. Any use of this framework must:

- Obtain proper informed consent
- Implement strict data access controls
- Follow applicable privacy regulations
- Maintain data security standards

### No Individual-Level Decisions

This framework should **never** be used to make decisions about specific individuals, including:

- Educational placement
- Employment decisions
- Insurance determinations
- Family planning without genetic counseling
- Any form of discrimination

---

## Validation Requirements

Before any findings from this framework inform downstream research:

1. Results must be replicated in independent cohorts
2. Pathway associations require experimental validation
3. Therapeutic hypotheses require preclinical and clinical testing
4. All claims must undergo peer review

---

## Regulatory Status

This framework:

- Is not FDA-cleared or approved
- Is not CE-marked
- Has not been validated for clinical use
- Should not be used in any regulated clinical context

Future clinical applications would require independent regulatory pathways and validation.
