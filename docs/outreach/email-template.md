## Template 1: Initial Contact (Short)

**Subject:** Collaboration opportunity: Pathway-based ASD subtype analysis

---

Dear Dr. [NAME],

I'm reaching out regarding your work on [SPECIFIC PAPER/COHORT]. I've developed an open-source framework for pathway-based analysis of genetic heterogeneity in autism, and I'm looking for collaborators with cohort data to validate the approach.

**The framework** (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18403844):
- Aggregates rare variants into pathway disruption scores
- Identifies molecular subtypes via unsupervised clustering
- Includes built-in validation gates (negative controls, stability testing)
- Runs locally—your data never leaves your infrastructure

**What I'm looking for:**
- Collaborators with ASD WES/WGS cohorts (N ≥ 100)
- Feedback on pathway definitions from domain experts
- Potential co-authorship on validation studies

You can try the demo in 5 minutes via Google Colab (no installation):
https://colab.research.google.com/github/topmist-admin/autism-pathway-framework/blob/main/examples/notebooks/01_demo_end_to_end.ipynb

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss whether this might be useful for your research?

Best regards,
Rohit Chauhan

## Template 2: Follow-up (After 7 Days)

**Subject:** Re: Collaboration opportunity: Pathway-based ASD subtype analysis

---

Dear Dr. [NAME],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about the Autism Pathway Framework. I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief.

Since my last email, we've released v0.1.0 with:
- Full reproducibility verification (CI + golden outputs)
- Colab-ready demo notebook
- Comprehensive documentation

If pathway-based subtype analysis isn't a current priority for your lab, I'd appreciate any suggestions for colleagues who might be interested.

Best regards,
Rohit Chauhan

## Template 3: Conference/Meeting Follow-up

**Subject:** Following up from [CONFERENCE NAME]

---

Dear Dr. [NAME],

It was great meeting you at [CONFERENCE/EVENT]. I enjoyed our discussion about [TOPIC].

As mentioned, I've been developing an open-source framework for pathway-based analysis of ASD genetic heterogeneity. The framework is now publicly available:

- GitHub: https://github.com/topmist-admin/autism-pathway-framework
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18403844
- Try it: [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/topmist-admin/autism-pathway-framework/blob/main/examples/notebooks/01_demo_end_to_end.ipynb)

I'd love to explore whether this could be useful for [THEIR COHORT/PROJECT]. Would you have time for a 20-minute call in the next few weeks?

Best regards,
Rohit Chauhan

## Template 4: Biobank/Consortium Contact

**Subject:** Research collaboration inquiry: ASD pathway analysis framework

---

Dear [BIOBANK/CONSORTIUM] Team,

I'm writing to inquire about potential research collaboration using [BIOBANK NAME] data.

I've developed an open-source computational framework for pathway-based analysis of genetic heterogeneity in Autism Spectrum Disorder. The framework:

- Aggregates rare variant burden into biological pathway scores
- Identifies molecular subtypes through validated clustering
- Includes negative controls and stability testing
- Is fully reproducible (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18403844)

**Research question:** Can pathway-level analysis identify clinically meaningful ASD subtypes that replicate across independent cohorts?

**Data needs:**
- Exome/genome sequencing data (VCF format)
- Basic phenotype information (diagnosis, demographics)
- Ideally N ≥ 100 ASD cases

I would be happy to provide additional documentation or discuss the analysis plan in detail.

Best regards,
Rohit Chauhan

## Notes for Customization

1. **Research their work first** — Reference a specific paper or project
2. **Keep it short** — Initial emails should be < 200 words
3. **Make it easy** — Provide the Colab link for instant demo
4. **Be specific** — State exactly what you're looking for
5. **Follow up** — Schedule a reminder for 7 days later
