## Outreach Tracking

| Date | Lab/Contact | Method | Status | Follow-up |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | [Name] | Email | Sent | +7 days |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

## Notes

1. **Start with Tier 1** — These have the largest cohorts and highest impact
2. **Personalize each email** — Reference their specific papers/cohorts
3. **Follow up at +7 days** — If no response
4. **Track in spreadsheet** — Update status after each contact
5. **Conference networking** — ASHG, ISCB, ISMB are good venues

## SFARI Data Access (Recommended First Step)

SFARI provides the largest accessible ASD cohorts:

1. Go to https://base.sfari.org
2. Create researcher account
3. Submit data access application
4. Specify: "Pathway-based subtype analysis using Autism Pathway Framework"
5. Typical approval: 2-4 weeks

This gives access to SSC and SPARK exome/genome data for validation.
