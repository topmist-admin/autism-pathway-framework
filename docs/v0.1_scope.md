## Research-Only Boundary

### This Framework Is

- Research instrumentation for exploring biological heterogeneity
- Hypothesis-generating, not conclusion-asserting
- Open-source and reproducible
- Designed for computational biology researchers

### This Framework Is NOT

- A diagnostic tool
- A screening instrument
- A treatment recommendation system
- A clinical decision support tool
- A patient-level prediction system

### Required Disclaimers

All outputs must include:

```
Research use only. Not medical advice.
All hypotheses require independent experimental and clinical validation.
```

| OS | Version | Status |
|----|---------|--------|
| macOS | 12+ (Monterey+) | ✅ Primary |
| Ubuntu | 20.04+ | ✅ Supported |
| Windows | 10+ (WSL2) | ⚠️ Tested via WSL2 |

### Python Version

| Version | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Python 3.10 | ✅ Supported |
| Python 3.11 | ✅ Supported |
| Python 3.12 | ✅ Supported |
| Python 3.13 | ⚠️ Experimental |

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB |
| Storage | 5 GB free | 20 GB free |
| CPU | 4 cores | 8 cores |
| GPU | Not required | Optional (CUDA 11.8+) |

## Expected Runtime

### Demo Dataset (Golden Path)

| Stage | Expected Time | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Environment setup | 5-10 min | One-time |
| Data loading | < 1 min | Synthetic demo data |
| Variant processing | 2-3 min | ~1000 variants |
| Pathway scoring | 5-10 min | Including network propagation |
| Clustering | 2-5 min | GMM + stability |
| Validation gates | 5-10 min | Negative controls + bootstrap |
| Report generation | < 1 min | JSON + Markdown + PNG |
| **Total** | **20-40 min** | Well under 60 min target |

### Full Cohort (Estimated)

| Cohort Size | Variants | Expected Time |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 100 samples | ~50K variants | 1-2 hours |
| 500 samples | ~250K variants | 4-8 hours |
| 1000 samples | ~500K variants | 8-16 hours |

*Times assume 8-core CPU, 16 GB RAM, no GPU.*
